# psNakivo

Powershell Module for the Nakivo-API

## Usage

See [this](docs/psNakivo.md) page for further information which commands are already implemented and how to use them

## Hints

- This module currently only implements very few commands. More commands will be implemented over time.
- You must first connect to a Nakivo server using the [Connect-Nakivo](docs/Connect-Nakivo.md) command. After that you can use the other nakivo commands to retrieve information, update things, etc.
